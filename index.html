  <p>The beautiful <a href="https://www.visitmt.com/listings/general/hot-springs-resort/boulder-hot-springs">Hot Springs Hotel</a> was build 1866 in beautiful Hope County, Montana.</p>

  <p>On May 12, 1902, a 7.6 earthquake struck the hotel. A resulting landslide caused the death of 16 people, who's bodies were never recovered. While the hotel was rebuilt, many claim that the grounds are still haunted by those lost in the slide.</p>

  <p>But don't let that stop you from enjoying the relaxing hot springs pools, located right outside the hotel! Or take a short walk to the <a href="https://farcry.fandom.com/wiki/Mastodon_Geothermal_Park">Mastodon Geothermal Park</a>, and learn all about the ancient giants that once called Montana home!</p>
